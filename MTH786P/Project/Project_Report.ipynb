    "**Problem**: We are tasked with the problem of predicting the approval or rejection of loan applications based on applicant financial and demographic metrics. The dataset consists of $s$ independent observations, each corresponding to a single historical loan application, together with a binary target variable indicating the final loan status.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a typical supervised binary classifcation problem since we are predicting class labels given explanatory variables, where class labels can take on two possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this task, ridge-regularised logistic regression is implemented from scratch using only NumPy. The resulting model is then compared against two benchmark approaches: logistic regression implemented via $\\texttt{scikit-learn}$, and a classification tree with controlled depth. We include this models to validate our model implementation, assess predictive performance, and consider varying the benefits of varying model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is first randomly partitioned into a training set and a held-out test set, using an 80/20 split. Model selection is then performed just on the training data via $K$-fold cross-validation, with the regularisation hyperparameter selected to maximise cross-validated accuracy. Final model evaluation is carried out on the held-out test set using standard classification metrics, including accuracy, confusion matrices, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study aims to construct a predictive model for loan approval that balances predictive performance and interpretability. The study concludes with an interpretation of the learned model parameters and an assessment of predictive performance relative to alternative classification models."

    "\n",
    "1. **Train–test split.**  \n",
    "   The dataset was randomly partitioned into a training set and a held-out test set using an 80/20 split. All subsequent preprocessing and model selection steps were performed exclusively on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling of missing values.**  \n",
    "   The dataset contains no missing values across the selected features; therefore, no imputation was required.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature standardisation.**  \n",
    "   All numerical features were standardised to zero mean and unit variance using statistics computed on the training set. This ensures that all features are placed on a comparable scale and prevents variables with large magnitudes from dominating the optimisation objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardisation is particularly important for ridge-regularised models, as the $\\ell_2$ penalty depends directly on the scale of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Visual Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain insight into the structure of the data, exploratory analysis was conducted on the numerical features and the target variable. Figure references below correspond to plots generated in the accompanying notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distribution of the target variable highlights the moderate class imbalance between approved and rejected loans.\n",
    "- Histograms of numerical features reveal substantial variation in scale prior to standardisation.\n",
    "- The correlation matrix of numerical features (see corresponding figure) shows strong positive correlations among income and asset-related variables, indicating the presence of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations motivate the use of ridge regularisation in the subsequent modelling stage, as well as careful interpretation of learned model coefficients.\n"
