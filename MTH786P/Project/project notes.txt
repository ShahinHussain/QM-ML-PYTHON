- maybe train model without income_annum and compare

"""
EDA CONCLUSIONS
---------------
- The target variable (loan_status) shows moderate class balance.
- Categorical variables (education, self_employed) do not strongly separate
  the target marginally, but are retained for conditional effects.
- Numeric variables show strong correlations, particularly among income,
  loan amount, and asset-related features, indicating multicollinearity.
- All variables are retained and multicollinearity will be addressed using
  L2-regularised (ridge) logistic regression.
"""


To-do:
- Compare with other models
- Extra-mile: find relevant articles online for motivation. 
    Motivation of what? 
    Maybe for not dropping variables. Our reason: ridge logistic regression handles multicollinearity well by scaling down coefficients that are not relevant.



  Comparison:
    Direct:
    “Performance is comparable to sklearn, validating our implementation”
    “Minor differences are expected due to optimisation and stopping criteria”
    “Regularisation improves stability under multicollinearity”
    “Linear models perform competitively on this dataset”




“The ridge-regularised logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 91.9% on the test set, comparable to the sklearn implementation (92.1%), validating the correctness of the custom implementation.
A decision tree classifier achieved higher accuracy (97.4%) and superior ROC performance, suggesting the presence of non-linear interactions among features.
However, logistic regression remains competitive while offering greater interpretability and robustness to multicollinearity. These results highlight the trade-off between predictive performance and model transparency.”
